        One of the most popular pastimes is watching movies among many. Every
        person has a specific preference for the type of film they would like to
        watch or has become their favorite genre over time. There is hardly
        anyone who does not love to watch movies. The audio and visual medium
        can capture the individuals' attention very well compared to any other
        medium. People love the medium as they can get quickly engaged into it.
        People often get disconnected from the world when they are involved in
        watching any movies or TV series that provide entertainment and
        relaxation. Hence movies have and will always remain equally popular.
        The movie industry is the most booming worldwide. The modern method of
        watching movies is via the Internet and is slowly replacing the
        traditional methods. In the beginning, there were the theatres where
        people would visit with their friends or family to watch movies and
        spend some quality time.

          Then came the drive-in that went side by side along with the theatres.
          Eventually, the movie industry grew up as the demand for movies
          increased, making it a great business. Then, the theatres' popularity
          came down due to the televisions that could allow people to watch
          movies from their homes' comfort and privacy. Eventually, the films
          were made available in compact disks and DVDs to play them by
          connecting the players to the television. Now people had the option to
          watch the movies at the time feasible to them. However, there was
          still a problem. The viewers now saw that they did not have an
          extensive choice in their hands. It was not possible to store an
          extensive collection of CDs or DVDs in the home of the movies they
          wanted to watch. It was also impossible to fill in the PCs' hard drive
          with the films' files. Finally came the Internet as well as the
          solution to the problem. It was how the journey of online movies
          began. Online movie databases allow you to watch movies online and
          have an extensive collection of movies much more than what one can
          keep at home or an offline library. The viewers can now watch the
          latest releases whenever and wherever they want. Also, if they love
          and wish to download the movie into the hard drives of their PC, they
          can do it. However, it is optional and unnecessary as long as the
          users have access to the Internet. The movie sites often ask for
          surveys to put it up with the costs of hosting the site and hosting
          ads on their sites. The sites have other content apart from the
          movies, which include TV series, anime, etc. Social networking sites
          such as YouTube, DailyMotion, Vimeo, etc. have also bought many
          changes in the way people can watch movies online. Video production
          companies like Warner Bros. and Fox have tapped in this opportunity
          and permitted these sites to stream their films for a small fee. The
          movie streaming sites do not compromise with quality.

          You can instantly watch a 720p or 1080p movie by streaming it from
          popular sites such as Netflix. You can also watch movies that have had
          a recent release. You can also have the benefit of choosing the
          language you wish to watch the film. It is why now movie enthusiasts
          can watch the movies released in languages despite their mother
          language. It is evident with the recent popularity of the Spanish,
          German or Turkish film and TV series in the Americas and across
          different parts of the world.
